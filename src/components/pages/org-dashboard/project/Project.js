                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>Netflix Conductor is a Workflow Orchestration engine that runs in the cloud. It is designed to be totally flexible - your microservices can run in any cloud, in any language, and Conductor can wire them together into a resilient workflow.

Conductor was built by Orkesâ€™ founders while at Netflix and was then open-sourced, resulting in widespread adoption driven by a passionate developer community. A wide range of enterprises from Fortune 100s to startups depends on Conductor for mission-critical business cases.

Orkes is a cloud hosted, fully managed version of Netflix Conductor offering full compatibility with the open source version.
This hackathon utilizes Orkes Playground, a free fully managed browser based sandbox environment of Conductor.

Welcome to the The Orkes Hack where you have the opportunity to collaborate intensively on Netflix Conductor with creative minds from across the globe and win amazing prizes! </p>
